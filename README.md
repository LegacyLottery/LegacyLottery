## Hi there 👋
## This is the start of the Legacy Lottery.
## Be patient and engage.
## First contributor (project founder) will be added soon.
## This is a real project and no Pump and Dump.
## Telegram will be restricted due to bot attack during the first weeks.
## If you have serious questions post them in the Telegram Chat and I'll add them to a FAQ that will be on the website of the project.
## If someone is able and willing to work with us, please be patient.
## Due to the heavy amount of bad actors trying to undermine the project it may be hard to get recognized by the technical operator.
## I'll keep you informed through this readme during the first days.
## If you're willing to create a website, open an issue pls.
